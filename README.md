# Basic Chat App for Portfolio

A quick and dirty React chat app using Chat Engine API, modelled very loosely on Microsoft Teams. Chat Feed was re-done from scract for practice, but wow, you can get a basic chat app up quick with Chat Engine! That was fun!

Users can add images, read receipts, multiple users, add and delete chatrooms, etc. 
Lots more to be done, including delete/edit individual messages and improved mobile functionality.
